        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                My graph supporting the gender pay gap discussion at the Festival of Economics: Dimmensions of Inequalities. The graph looks at the gender pay gap between different types of empolyment. This graph supports the arguement that the UK still has inequalities that are decreasing over time.

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            My graph exploring the growth of annual income seperated by gender. During the talk, Richard explored the narrative of annual income growth amongst men but neglected to make the comparison against women's annual income growth. Women's annual income on average out performed on growth. Hower if we were to look at this critically, the gender pay gap is still prevelvant. In order to mitigate this women's annual income must grow substaincially more.
