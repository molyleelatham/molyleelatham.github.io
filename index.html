                    As a first example, we're using a basic chart from our repo.

                <p>
                    My graph supporting the gender pay gap discussion at the Festival of Economics: Dimensions of Inequalities. The graph looks at the gender pay gap between different types of employment. This graph supports the argument that the UK still has inequalities that are decreasing over time.

                <p>
                    My graph exploring the growth of annual income separated by gender. During the talk, Richard explored the narrative of annual income growth amongst men but neglected to make the comparison against women's annual income growth. Women's annual income on average out performed on growth. However if we were to look at this critically, the gender pay gap is still prevalent. In order to mitigate this women's annual income must grow substantially more.
